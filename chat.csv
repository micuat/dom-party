0,"Yeah, no, it's recording."
1,"So yeah, I I I could have. Yeah, how are you?"
2,So you don't have a camera today.
3,Or was it?
4,Turn off OK.
5,Hello.
6,"So yeah, how's it going after?"
7,"When was the last time we went like 2 days ago or something? Three days seems it seems like one week ago, but it was just on Wednesday. Yeah, yeah. So today Saturday."
8,Three days ago.
9,Right?
10,"Was the nose intense? I feel like I'm not intense. Have you actually watched it afterwards? No, I couldn't give you."
11,I watched part. Yeah I watched part there watching force. Yeah saying I think it's OK like it's it's a bit long to watch for the full 2 hours.
12,"But there are some interesting parts in it like I was like I sent you some things like I was working playing with. I didn't watch the last link that you sent me in the there was a hydro link that you sent me. It's OK, that's something else. I mean it's related."
13,"But it's the same. Same idea I was. Anyways, let's go back to the practice."
14,I really like the part when I was playing the previous.
15,Practice and I left the room.
16,"Yeah, yeah that that was kind of, but did we talk?"
17,I will talk afterwards in the. In the chat there will be a public.
18,Rice
19,"yeah about the playback because the playback idea. So I think you were doing something like that. I think it's a good idea to maybe proposal the next time to consciously do something about the playback. Yeah, yeah. What I noticed was like."
20,"I like how you code because you're in the same room but also like how you called the poster is like as always, you know have the same like you have the same poster and then that really mess up my mind like you're wearing different clothes but like different T shirt. But you look like doing the same thing."
21,In different windows.
22,"Right, yeah, I have the same feeling with when I have because I have I put together the first last practices and I have the same impression with you because you have the same clothes."
23,Give us this money because that's something I consciously you.
24,"But I think you were just, you know, hug it or whatever the space that looks the same."
25,In a different time.
26,"And this is like I don't know what like I wanted to say, but this is something really."
27,"Gives the depth. It's not. At first, I was just thinking that it makes it like."
28,"More complex in a way, this whole practice by having different time in parallel, but."
29,It's also like aesthetically it's really interesting because as a viewer.
30,"I can focus on like different parts of the video, right? It's no longer like one thing and you can actually as like as a viewer, you can make your own story because."
31,It like not everyone's looking at the same thing.
32,"I mean the way home. I don't know if I completely understand what you're saying, but."
33,"How I see this display back thing is that it works very well when they offset is not that long and I mean not, not literally in terms of time, because in time it will work but also the set up as you said."
34,"Because then it gives. If you're thinking sounds, for instance these oscillations. They work like the sign in cosine, cosine wave. They work, but when they don't have, the offset is not that long, because otherwise they're completely two different things when they set. The offset is just a tiny bit and offset when you have."
35,Or how it's called?
36,"Residents know how it's called, what is called."
37,Uhm?
38,High school.
39,"Some kind of filter, some kind of filter that you get when you have this slightly offset?"
40,"You mean like with the sound we disarming with the sound, but in a way generates the same? I mean is, I'm just doing my."
41,"Putting things together but in a way it even sound is very clear because the wave because there is a cosine, cosine and this time at some point they are differently, but at some point they crossed and when they cross then they generate this filter. I don't remember the name for that, but it's just some sort of specific sound that is being created of that moment."
42,"An but are you talking about like when you have two different, like slightly different frequencies?"
43,"Yes, services start to feel here. The low frequency oscillation. Yeah they love the low pass. Yeah, lowpass, highpass, lowpass."
44,"So anyways, I'm just saying that is a it's similar somehow."
45,"I don't know like scientifically speaking, but I'm just doing my conjunction. This should be somehow a similar effect when we when the playback is slightly offset."
46,"Yeah, yeah, I think."
47,It makes sense.
48,Like
49,the drink actually. The second link I sent you is something totally different.
50,But what I did was.
51,I recorded video from a train like I was. I was on the train and just looking outside the window and fill recorded for like 15 minutes.
52,And then I took it at home I.
53,Play that and I was like coding with Hydra to create images on top of this I'm using this video buffer.
54,So I was like going for 50 minutes with the same duration for the same video and then I put them together. So I have the original video. I have actually another recording of the keyboard like how I'm typing.
55,"Together with the Hydra that gives effect, and also there's a."
56,Like the editor that shows what I was quoting.
57,Cape.
58,And like they're doing like for the one I sent you before with the practice. It's the same thing like I was doing the practice. And like there's life editor that was.
59,Showing what I was calling during the practice but not in the video but on the web page.
60,"And in both cases, like you can just scroll the playback head and jump to another place and it's still it's continuing with the. You know it follows the time that I coded in the practice or in this video, right?"
61,So why I'm saying this?
62,"Well, in this case the latter one I did was has a lot of offset in that sense because I was filming outside the train and I was."
63,"Filming the keyboard that I was typing, but which I found really nice, was that I could see my hand typing and that's also affects the editor that's shown on the web page."
64,"So as I type in the video, it shows up on the editor."
65,And the training video is something totally different. But like you make the correlation between the editor the the code I'm typing and the keyboard I'm using.
66,Which.
67,I found this very interesting.
68,And I think it's more obviously in practice because I'm I'm actually there and I'm coding and you can see the editor as well.
69,"And it's not just the meeting myself, but it's also."
70,With you and me and the videos blended.
71,Is a in the practice we had this you know this swirl thing at the end.
72,And.
73,I yeah I. I think I made it full screen blending between our bodies.
74,"And then as soon as I become you. So I'm not on the screen anymore, I start typing, let me start recording."
75,I add more effects or text.
76,"But actually I think in your video you can see me coding. Yeah, because you had to like open."
77,It's just like constantly.
78,Just like switch is big jumps around the attention you know in the two videos and editor.
79,And.
80,"If I have more videos, for example with keyboard typing and stuff like that, that could be also interesting."
81,I see.
82,I see what I mean.
83,"So yeah, I think it's like offset is one thing. But also like."
84,"How you correlate things? Because if they are like totally different videos then they yeah they they they they they doesn't. It doesn't work, I mean or it might work, but I just think it's more difficult."
85,"Yeah, I think as a viewer you try to understand what's behind it, right? OK, yeah, yeah."
86,But like it sometimes works sometimes doesn't work or the artist doesn't have any idea why they put these videos.
87,"But it's also like it's hard. Like if you think about this offset, it's hard to make content like create bunch of contents that."
88,Share is the same context.
89,"Like in our case, we in our case, can you repeat what you said so just have a make a bunch of videos that look similar, let's say so we can play with but making those videos is actually hard because."
90,"It's not like you have to do something repeatedly, right? Or you have to constantly look look for something that has similar aesthetics. But in our case it's easy because we have the practice every week or so and we have bunch of videos already."
91,"Yeah we have their kites, yeah?"
92,"And I think that's something like. I think it's makes sense that this discussion is happening now, like not when we started practice, because that's not something we expected to have, like kind of save practice or not the same. But you know, like similar, when we have the same protocol."
93,More or less and.
94,"We continue it. So now we have this archive, but at first we didn't think about making an archive."
95,"Yeah, you just make me think now. Like could you imagine like?"
96,"What what would be if we? Because basically we talk in a way. It seems to me, is like goes around and ontological process. We're trying to define what are, what are the elements of what are the things that we do and try to make some sort of sense of where are they?"
97,"So can you try to imagine like that in a practice we try to really, you know, try to understand. OK now to wait, why are you using this keyword, you know?"
98,"Like that could be completely different, you know, because it's like I understand partly of what you said, but most of what you said is my interpretation of what you were saying."
99,"So if in the context of the practice I really try to just understand why are you taking those decisions, what does the video means to you when you don't? It will be completely different."
100,Yeah.
101,"Well, I think we talked about this before, but yet we have this chat to somehow come back to the ideas behind your decisions in a way."
102,Yeah.
103,"Which is which is good because it doesn't happen during the practice, otherwise it will be just, you know."
104,I don't know how it's going to be like. Maybe you can try one time. Just try to explain everything you're doing.
105,"But I think sometimes it happens more in developing time, though you or me are busy and at some point we start trying to explain something to the other one and the other one might pay attention for certain periods. But if it takes too long then just."
106,"You continue from what you're doing, and while the other one keeps on trying to explain."
107,Now that's very funny.
108,
109,"OK, maybe yeah, shall we stop the chat and then we can talk? Yeah, more so please subscribe. I don't know if I'm going to publish this though I probably think this is. This is interesting. Yeah, thank you for watching."
